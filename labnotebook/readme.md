Initial humidity instrumentation test and baselines:
* 30% realative humidity basement baseline
* 96% realative humidity shoe (post 4 mile run)
* 46% realative humidity shoe w/ bootdryer fan blowing after 30 seconds 5:05pm
* 28% realative humidity shoe at 5:24pm
* 32% realative humidityat shoe 5:37pm
* stopped bootdryer at 5:42pm to check humidity of shoe - is 34%
* started bootdryer again at 5:43pm to check humidity with fan running - is 34%
* stopped bootdryer at 5:44pm to check humidity of room - is 30% 3 ft from shoes, 33% 1 ft from shoes

See [dataset](dateset_20160228_humidity.csv)

Remaining Questions?
* object (no humidity) w/ fan blowing it it ?
* graphy humidity over time
  * what's the sweet spot?
