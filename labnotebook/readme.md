Initial humidity instrumentation test and baselines:
* 30% realative humidity basement baseline
* 96% realative humidity shoe (post 4 mile run)
* 46% realative humidity shoe w/ bootdryer fan blowing after 30 seconds 5:05pm
* 28% realative humidity shoe at 5:24pm
* 32% realative humidityat shoe 5:37pm

Questions?
* object (no humidity) w/ fan blowing it it ?
* graphy humidity over time
  * what's the sweet spot?
