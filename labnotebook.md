## Notes

### 2/28/2016

Initial humidity instrumentation test and baselines:
* 30% baseline basement humidity
* 96% baseline shoe (post 4 mile run)
* 46% baseline shoe w/ bootdryer fan blowing after 30 seconds 5:05pm
* 28% at 5:24pm

Questions?
* object (no humidity) w/ fan blowing it it ?
* graphy humidity over time
  * what's the sweet spot?
